<p>Coffee in Philly, in my time here, has gone from really sparse offerings, to having some very interesting options available.</p>
<h3><u>Here are some great coffee options in Philly:</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Reanimator - Sort of boring in a way, and pricy and snobbish, but they make decent coffee.</li>
    <li>Menagerie - This is just a small shop - they don't roast their own beans, but have a terrific program.</li>
    <li>Cloud Coffee - Like Menagerie, they do not roast their own, but have an amazing program.</li>
    <li>Blind Tiger Coffee</li>
    <li>Ultimo - Cult favorite of 3rd wave coffee enthusiasts.</li>
    <li>Elixr - Cool shop, almost too cool.</li>
    <li>Peddler - I have actually never been, but hear great things about this small shop.</li>
    <li>Ox Coffee - Cool shop, not my favorite roasting style (overdeveloped), but good quality and good people.</li>
    <li>Passenger - in the Bok building. I have not been here but what a cool looking place, and owner operated.</li>
    <li>Shot Tower - cool little shop in Old City.</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Now, here are a few shops that will make you cry, or regret your purchase, if you go there, but everyone seems to love anyway, for a number of reasons that I don't understand:</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>La Colombe - people love this place, but look the owner up, read about his maniacal plan, then consider the freakishly over-embellished shops they run and over-the-top product design, then cry a little bit.</li>
    <li>Saxby's - go here if you enjoy:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Old milk</li>
        <li>The scent of hockey gloves</li>
        <li>Coffee from an industrial roaster</li>
        <li>Sticky residue</li>
        <li>Humidity</li>
        <li>Thawed Milkshakes</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Starbucks - everyone has them, philly loves them(????)</li>
    <li>Dunkin (formerly Dunkin Donuts) - Yes, they fancy themselves a coffee operation</li>
    <li>WaWa - any place that sounds like a baby named it, and they serve coffee and food, stay away</li>
    <li>Ox Coffee - notice how it's also in the good list?  They just over roast.</li>
</ul>
